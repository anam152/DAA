Design and Analysis of Algorithms Laboratory
Introduction
This repository contains laboratory exercises, programs, and resources related to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course. It is a fork of the original repository https://github.com/anam152/DAA.git?authuser=1 and has been customized to suit personal or institutional requirements.

Purpose
The repository serves the following purposes:

To provide implementations of fundamental algorithms.
To demonstrate theoretical concepts practically.
To offer a platform for further learning and exploration in algorithm design.
Contents
The repository includes:

Sorting Algorithms: Implementations of Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
Graph Algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's and Kruskal's), etc.
Dynamic Programming: Examples like the Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence, Matrix Chain Multiplication, etc.
Divide and Conquer: Algorithms such as Merge Sort and Quick Sort.
Greedy Algorithms: Examples like Huffman Coding and Activity Selection.
